This includes people aged 65 and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and people who work outdoors."

If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n Tips to reduce your smoke exposure\n\nSmoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\nWhen indoor, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.\nWhen there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality, prioritize keeping cool.\nProtect your indoor air from wildfire smoke. Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to the fine particles in the smoke. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nCheck on others who are in your care or live nearby who may be more likley to be impacted by wildfire smoke.\nAlways follow guidance from local authorities."

There is some overlap between areas of Metro Vancouver (e.g. Horseshoe Bay, Lions Bay, Bowen Island) considered part of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed and the Howe Sound zone used by BC ENV for issuing smoky skies bulletins. A Smoky Skies Bulletin could be issued by BC ENV for the Howe Sound zone before the thresholds are reached to trigger an air quality advisory issued by Metro Vancouver for these overlapping parts of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed. This should not be interpreted as conflicting information; it reflects the different approaches to notifications about wildfire smoke within the two agencies.\nInland Vancouver Island: includes Lake Cowichan, Nahmint, Port Alberni, central portions of Strathcona Park and Schoen Lake Provincial Park.\nNorth Okanagan: includes Vernon, Armstrong, Enderby, Lavington and Lumby."
