    "text": "During smoky conditions\nExpand AllCollapse All Follow your common sense\n\nStop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you feel unwell.\nStay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\nIf you have asthma or other chronic illness, carry any rescue (fast-acting) medications with you at all times and activate your personal care plan that has been designed with your family physician.\nMake sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.\n\n Monitor your symptoms\n\nPeople respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\nIf you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\nIf you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n Tips to reduce your smoke exposure\n\nSmoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\nRunning a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located.\nIf you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\nReduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods.\nConsider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\nIf travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate.\nIf you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\nMaintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution."

There is some overlap between areas of Metro Vancouver (e.g. Horseshoe Bay, Lions Bay, Bowen Island) considered part of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed and the Howe Sound zone used by BC ENV for issuing smoky skies bulletins. A Smoky Skies Bulletin could be issued by BC ENV for the Howe Sound zone before the thresholds are reached to trigger an air quality advisory issued by Metro Vancouver for these overlapping parts of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed. This should not be interpreted as conflicting information; it reflects the different approaches to notifications about wildfire smoke within the two agencies.\nInland Vancouver Island: includes Lake Cowichan, Nahmint, Port Alberni, central portions of Strathcona Park and Schoen Lake Provincial Park.\nNorth Harrison Lake: extends north from mid Harrison Lake to Tipella."

These warnings are based on available pollutant concentrations information, satellite information, smoke forecast models and visual observations, and are not intended to manage local emission sources.",
