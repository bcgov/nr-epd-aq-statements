There is some overlap between areas of Metro Vancouver (e.g. Horseshoe Bay, Lions Bay, Bowen Island) considered part of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed and the Howe Sound zone used by BC ENV for issuing smoky skies bulletins. A Smoky Skies Bulletin could be issued by BC ENV for the Howe Sound zone before the thresholds are reached to trigger an air quality advisory issued by Metro Vancouver for these overlapping parts of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed. This should not be interpreted as conflicting information; it reflects the different approaches to notifications about wildfire smoke within the two agencies.\nInland Vancouver Island: includes Lake Cowichan, Nahmint, Port Alberni, central portions of Strathcona Park and Schoen Lake Provincial Park.\nWilliston: includes McLeod Lake, Mackenzie and Williston Lake."

A Smoky Skies Bulletin could be issued by BC ENV for the Howe Sound zone before the thresholds are reached to trigger an air quality advisory issued by Metro Vancouver for these overlapping parts of the Lower Fraser Valley Airshed.

    "text": "During smoky conditions\nExpand AllCollapse All Follow your common sense\n\nStop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you feel unwell.\nStay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\nCarry any rescue medications with you at all times.\nMake sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.\n\n Monitor your symptoms\n\nDifferent people have different responses to smoke.\nMild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\nMore serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains or severe cough.\nPeople with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any personal care plans designed with their family physicians.\nIf you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\nIf you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n Tips to reduce your smoke exposure\n\nSmoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\nWhen indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.\nWhen there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality, prioritize keeping cool.\nProtect your indoor air from wildfire smoke. Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to the fine particles in the smoke. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nCheck on others who are in your care or live nearby who may be more likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke.\nAlways follow guidance from local authorities."
